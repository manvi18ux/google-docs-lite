/*This middleware checks if the user is logged in and has a valid token before letting them access protected routes (like creating or editing a document).

It’s like a security guard standing at the door of every protected API route.

In simple terms:

User logs in → gets a token.

Next time they send a request → they attach that token.

This middleware checks the token → if valid, user continues; if not, access denied.

🧱 Real-life example:

Imagine your app is a library:

Only people with valid ID cards (tokens) can enter.

The guard (this middleware) checks the ID before letting them in.

If the card is fake or expired → you can’t enter.*/
